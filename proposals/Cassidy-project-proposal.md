Today, the underlying physics that govern the performance of modern biomass cookstoves are largely unkown, leaving many modern advancements of cookstove design to be informed by inneficient and costly "trial and error" based experimental efforts. Poviding an accurate and accessible computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package could serve as a helpful tool for cookstove designers. The goal of the present work is to create a software package that will perform a steady state CFD analysis given a user-imported CAD model. Ultimately, the package wil return a set of results related to the performance of the cookstove; more specifically, the results will present the composition of the product gas exiting the cookstove. The expected inputs are as follows: a single 2-dimensional .STEP cookstove CAD model, steady state power produced by the combustion process (based on existing literature), flow models, and combustion mechanism. The outputs are expected to include species compostion at the cookstove exit, and temperature profile and flow field within the combustion chamber. The relevant exising work within the biomass cookstove modelling domain, and the window which makes the present study novel are as follows

There is a small handful of existing peer-reviewed publications related to cookstove CFD modelling which will serve as support for the physical model and assumptions used in the present study. Pundle et al. presented a 2-dimensional, axisymetric, steady state CFD model of a natural draft cookstove with coupled sub-models for combustion, turbulence, and heat transfer. Additionally, Miller-Loinberg produced a high-resolution 3-dimensional transient CFD model of a natural draft biomass cookstove. The existing numerical models are specific to individual cookstove models and are, therefore, limited in their long-term impact within the cookstove design community. The long-term impact of the models released by the academic community could be greatly improved by providing an open source and user friendly analytical tool with a gentle learning curve that could be used to model a multitude of cookstove CAD models.

The OpenFoam-V6 software will be used to run the fluid flow simulations; OpenFoam version 6 is free to public use and has a large existing Python library, called PyFoam, which will be used to setup models, run simulations, and analyze result of the CFD runs. Graphical User Interface development will not be included in the scope of the project..
